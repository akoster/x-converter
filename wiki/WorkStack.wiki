#summary Assignments for the project

Read about dependency injection (also called 'inversion of control'). Notable frameworks for this in Java are Spring and Google Guice. Bonus: add Guice to the project to inject the Storage implementations into AbstractTest.

Expand the xcon.abstr.AbstractTest so that the user can input commands:
  * read <key> : the application prints the value for that key
  * store <key> <value> : the application stores the given value under the given key
  * dump : the application prints all current keys and values
<key> is a String without whitespace
<value> is a String

Hint: use java.util.Scanner
