#summary Description of pilot classes

EnumPilot shows how enums can be used.

AbstractPilot shows how an abstract class can be used to allow multiple implementations for some methods, and enforce common implementations for other methods.

Note: another use of abstract classes is to encapsulate the lifecycle of a complex subsystem. Lifecycle methods which are left abstract must be implemented by concrete subclasses. Other lifecycle methods can be implemented in the abstract class, and are optional for subclasses to override. An example of a similar situation is in: javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.
